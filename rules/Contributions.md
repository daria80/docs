# Rules for creating a contribution

### If you want to contribute to existing projects in which we do not have the right to make changes by pushing the changes, you can create your own branch of the project.
 Next will be instructions on how to do this.
 #
 #
 #
## 1.
In order to create your own branch of the project, go to the project page and click on the “Create branch” 
(“Fork”) button, which is located in the upper right corner. After a few seconds, you will be redirected to your own new project page containing your copy in which you have write permissions.

## 2.
Create a thematic branch from the master branch. Then fix your changes in the project code in the thematic branch. And then submit a new branch to our copy on GitHub.

It is recommended to seriously approach the compilation of the description and make it as informative as possible so that the project owner understands why these changes and what benefits they will bring.
